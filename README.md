# pam

PAM interaction for Go.  Currently consists of functionality to implement your own module
for PAM to load/communicate with for each service.

## Credits

I looked off of [golang-pam-auth](https://github.com/AmandaCameron/golang-pam-auth) a bit for
initial coding of pam method translations.  Thanks has to go out to Amanda for her work here.
